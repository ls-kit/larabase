## Workflow
First: Finish user login/registration in Laravel.
Second: Make sure your Baserow env/config and service code match your new table names.
Third: Build out controllers and routes for course/lesson/quiz flow.
Fourth: Add minimal progress tracking (just lesson_user).
Fifth: Create simple Blade views to display data.



## Implementation Plan
2. Step-by-Step (Implementation Plan)
On each lesson page:

List all quizzes for that lesson.

Under each quiz, list all questions with radio/select/text input as needed.

Each quiz form has a Submit Quiz button.

When a quiz is submitted:

Save the user's answers and score for that quiz in the database.

Mark the quiz as completed for the user.

If all quizzes in this lesson are completed, enable the “Mark Lesson as Complete” button.

When a lesson is marked complete:

Update the lesson_user table as before.

Award points.

Progress tracking:

Show visual feedback: completed quizzes, completed lessons, daily/weekly/monthly stats.
